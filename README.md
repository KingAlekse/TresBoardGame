# TresBoardGame

Found a old board game from second hand store just for 5â‚¬. I was lucky, since it had all the pieces and instructions with it.
For practice, I started to program the game using pyhon and pygame library.

Currently only has working gui.
Next step is to practice building simple ai.

RULES FOR THE GAME:
Aim of the game is have tree in a row in inner circle (the red one).
Player first adds new piece from one of the 'corners'.
If this does not lead to win, then the player also rotates one of the circles.
  Circles can rotate only certain direction: inner and outer clockwise and middle counterclockwise.

And then is next players turn.

Rinse and repeat.
