# TresBoardGame

Found a old board game from second hand store just for 5â‚¬. I was lucky, since it had all the pieces and instructions with it.
For practice, I started to program the game using pyhon and pygame library.

Currently only has working text version for two players and unfinished gui.

Next steps are:
# 1. Improve commenting code
# 2. Implement actual gameplay with gui
# 3. Improve gui
# 4. Start building ai
